### Motivation
The current dependency `test_generator` does not support cargo workspace well. To address this limitation, we propose migrating to `datatest-stable`, which provides better support for cargo workspaces.

### Proposed Actions
1. Replace `test_generator` with `datatest-stable`.
2. Update existing test configurations to work with `datatest-stable`.
3. Ensure all tests continue to pass after the migration.

### Benefits
- Improved support for cargo workspace.
- Easier management and execution of tests across the project.
